description="Tween Orchestrator is a utility designed to simplify animations in Godot.
It allows you to add tween clips directly to an object, making it easier to animate properties like position, scale, rotation, or color without writing repetitive code. By organizing and managing multiple tweens in one place, Tween Orchestrator streamlines the animation process and helps you create smooth, dynamic effects with minimal effort."
